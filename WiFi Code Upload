The ESP32 can be programmed by WiFi, which suposed me an
advantage, since I can repair it without needing to disassemble 
the whole thing. This would supose a disadvantage because anyone could
access to it's code; BUT this can only work if the unwanted person 
knew the IP of the ESP32 and knew the password to achieve the connection.
I'll continue uploading new stuff, so do keep track! ;)
