I founded in Arduino Forum some code useful for transfering code via bñuetooth to the ESP32 (link: https://forum.arduino.cc/t/esp32-ota-via-bluetooth/1362458)
To do so, the file has to be a ".bin" type, since is the file transfered to the board when we compile it.
I added a function that shows the actual code, so you can see what your board has.
++don't forget to include in your new code this one if you want to upload more code in the future via bluetooth.++;
